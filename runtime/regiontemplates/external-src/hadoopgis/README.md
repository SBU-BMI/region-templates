# hadoopgis
Comprehensive Hadoop-GIS with extensions

To install locally all you need to do is run the script: install/installhadoop.sh

This script upgrades your environment paths/variables, as well as compile the binary automatically.
The makefile in src directory compiles all programs.

The two libraries used are geos and libspatial (both dependencies are installed automatically when you execute
install/installhadoopgis.sh)
